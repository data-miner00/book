# Cookbook

A HTML-format book written with Nuxt.js and TailwindCSS, where the UI are referenced directly from [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) for better experience in terms of user interface, as designing can be arduous and intimidating as it requires collective effort from multiple individuals with the corresponding expertise in UI/UX.

## Intentions

The decision to develop such book is rather coincidental, whereby I am studying some online articles and books about Rust and came across [this note](https://notes.iveselov.info/programming/cheatsheet-rust-option-vs-haskell-maybe) by Ivan Veselov and his teams on Gitbook, which immediately caught my attention and sparked the idea of developing an online book website that serves as the knowledge repository about some quick but important topics for me and my friends.
