In Minecraft, empowering tools and gears is one of the most important aspect of the game. Without enchantment, you will be facing a very hugh bottleneck in the game that **impedes further progression** at some point and **reduces your productivity** as well. Asides, without stacked armor that actually give much much more protection compared to the raw, unenchanted armor, you are extremely **vulnerable to dangers** poses by the game. There are a thousands way that you could die in game and it's definitely not a good experience to go through expecially in a hardcore world.

## Farming EXP

Without EXP, all of the ultimate enchantments is unobtainable. In fact, even with a exp farm at your disposal, farming the full set of gears is also going to take quite a while of grinding.

However, there is an EXP farm that is extremely effective and efficient that my friend recommended it to me that was found on Youtube in a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twL1dt1gOP0) by [Shulkercraft](https://www.youtube.com/c/Shulkercraft) With this farm you will get unlimited EXP without killing any mobs by yourself, everything is AFK-able. The best part is, it comes with free gold for the loot.

What we do is place an enchanting table along with some bookshelves on top of the trapdoor where you'll be standing. This way, you can farm exp and enchant at the same time with that gold farm!
