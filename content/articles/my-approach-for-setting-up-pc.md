As a developer, setting up a brand new computer from scratch can be quite an enduring process as the tools that we are using might have some complicated steps to setup but have forgotten over the years. Besides, there are so much softwares and tools that are essential but is impossible to remember each and every one of them.

In this article, I will be outlining the ideal steps for me to setting up my new computer for the softwares and development tools from the groundup.

## Software Application

Application such as IDEs, code editors and design tools are covered in this section. Moreover, my preferred internet browser and utility softwares will be outlined as well.

### IDEs

Essential development environment for various kinds of projects that I am/will be using all of the time.

| IDE                                                           | Programming Language |
