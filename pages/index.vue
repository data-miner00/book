            Hi. This is Shaun and this site was developed for me to document the
            knowledge that I've came across on various topics in the form of a
            note or memo for my future reference. This site is open to the
            public to benefit those who might need it.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have found an issue, kindly report the issues through the
            <strong>issues</strong> tab in the
            <a href="https://github.com/data-miner/book">Github Repo</a>.
          </p>

          <h1>More about the author</h1>

          <p>
            I am a freshgraduate software engineer based in
            <strong>Malaysia</strong>. I am passionate about learning foreign
            languages and currently learning English and Japanese. I like to
            develop software applications on my own to learn and experiment
            different technologies on different type of projects on my free
            time.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Incentive:</strong> Actually, I have reached out several
            friends to ask if they are willing to collaborate and contribute to
            this book about their knowledge but none of them met my expectation,
            if not, I would prefer building the knowledge repository with them
            together instead of working as a lone wolf.
          </p>

          <h1>Contacts</h1>

          <p>
            These are an extensive list of social media accounts of mine. I use
            Facebook and Instagram sparingly as I don't see any useful gains for
            binging it. I do however, use Twitter more frequent than I expected,
            mainly to scout the trending topics that people talks about in my
            country, particularly regarding to politics.
          </p>

          <h1>Rule of thumb</h1>

          <p>
            To provide a more intuitive and informative article, there are a few
            principles that I've always strive to follow.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Efficient use of tables, diagrams, images and proper wording.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read through the articles again and again, refactoring any
              inefficient use of wordings
            </li>
            <li>
              Research extensively online to get more information on the topic
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Todos</h1>

          <p>
            Although this seems like a very easy project, but the efforts are
            insurmountable to make it better and better, and hence it takes time
            and iteration to become fully-functional. Below shows some of the
            planned features that will be introduced incrementally in my free
            time.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Add more articles</li>
            <li>Add search function</li>
          </ul>
