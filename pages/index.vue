            Hi. This is Shaun from <strong>Malaysia</strong>. Currently learning
            English and Japanese and this notebook consists of various articles
            and tutorials that I've documented over the years which might be
            handy for numerous occasions that you might be going though as well.
            The book is currently under construction so it is expected to have
            some bugs and misalignement here and there. If you have found an
            issue, kindly report the issues through the
            <strong>issues</strong> tab in the [Github
            Repo](https://github.com/data-miner/book)
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Incentive:</strong> Actually, I have reached out several
            friends to ask if they are willing to collaborate and contribute to
            this book about their knowledge but none of them met my expectation,
            if not, I would prefer building the knowledge repository with them
            together instead of working as a lone wolf.
          </p>

          <h1>Rule of thumb</h1>

          <p>
            To provide a more intuitive and informative article, there are a few
            principles that I've always strive to follow.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Efficient use of tables, diagrams, images and proper wording.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read through the articles again and again, refactoring any
              inefficient use of wordings
            </li>
            <li>
              Research extensively online to get more information on the topic
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Todos</h1>

          <p>
            Although this seems like a very easy project, but the efforts are
            insurmountable to make it better and better, and hence it takes time
            and iteration to become fully-functional. Below shows some of the
            planned features that will be introduced incrementally in my free
            time.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Add more articles</li>
            <li>Add search function</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
